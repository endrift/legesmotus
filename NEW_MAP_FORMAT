A new map format has been introduced in Beta 2.  Unfortunately, as of release time, the format is still undocumented.  Check back at http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/legesmotus/ for documentation in the weeks following the release.

In case you have written maps in the old format, an awk script has been provided in the tools directory to convert to the new format.  Use the script as follows:

awk -f tools/migrate_map_file.awk < oldmapfile.map > newmapfile.map

(where oldmapfile.map is the name of the old map file, and newmapfile.map will be the name of the new file)

This script will produce map files that act the same and that are object-by-object identical with the original map.  However, it will not refactor the map to take advantage of new features, such as tiling obstacles.
