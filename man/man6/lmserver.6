.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Leges Motus is a networked, team\-based, 2D shooter set in zero\-gravity. Using only the force from jumping off of walls and the recoil from their guns, players must travel across the arena to lower their opponent's gate.
.LP 
This is the server program for Leges Motus.  It listens on a UDP port for packets from clients, and relays them to other connected clients.  In addition, the server is responsible for scorekeeping, team assignment, timing the gates, and notifying the clients of the map and rules in play.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.SH "NOTES"
.LP 
If no operator password is set on the command line, then any player connecting from the localhost (127.0.0.1) will be given operator status.  If this is undesirable behavior, then be sure to set an operator password.  (However, see \fBBUGS\fR below.)
.LP 
By default, the Leges Motus server will contact the meta server so other players on the Internet can connect to and play on the server (provided no firewalls are in the way).  If you would NOT like your server to appear in server browsers of other Internet users, pass the \-l ("local") option to lmserver.
.LP 
If you are behind a firewall and would like to make your server accessible to the Internet at large, you must allow/forward UDP port 16877.
.SH "FILES"
.LP 
\fI$LM_DATA_DIR/maps\fP
.br 
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.LP 
.TP 
\fBLM_DATA_DIR\fP
Specifies the location of the directory containing Leges Motus data files.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
To run the server in the background:
.LP 
lmserver \-d
.LP 
To run Leges Motus every time you start your computer, you could put this in a system startup script (e.g. /etc/rc.local):
.LP 
lmserver \-d \-u nobody
.LP 
If you don't want to register your server with the meta server:
.LP 
legesmotus \-l
.LP 
Run the server with the gamma3 map:
.LP 
legesmotus \-m gamma3
.LP 
To set an operator password:
.LP 
legesmotus \-P foobar

.SH "BUGS"
.LP 
The operator password is set on the command line, meaning it's visible to any user on the system through a call to \fIps\fR\|(1).
.LP 
The protocol documentation is very out\-of\-date.
