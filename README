ABOUT

Leges Motus is a 2D networked, team-based shooter set in zero gravity.


BUILDING

To build all components, type 'make' in the top-level directory.

If you would like to build only the client or only the server, you may type 'make client' or 'make server' in the top-level directory.

If you change any header file, you must type 'make clean' before re-building.


RUNNING THE CLIENT

To run the client, type './client/legesmotus' in the top-level directory.

The client supports the following command-line options:
  -n NAME	set your player name (default: your user name)
  -t red|blue	set your team (default: auto-balanced)
  -s SERVER	set the hostname of the server (default: the central development server)
  -p PORTNO	set the port number of the server (default: 16877)
  -w WIDTH	set the screen width, in pixels (default: 1024)
  -h HEIGHT	set the screen height, in pixels (default: 768)
  -?, --help	display this help, and exit
      --version	display version information and exit

If you specify the width and height of your actual screen resolution, the game will run in fullscreen.


REQUIREMENTS

The following libraries must be installed in order to build and run Leges Motus:

 SDL
 SDL_image
 SDL_ttf
 SDL_net
 SDL_mixer
 OpenGL


RUNNING THE SERVER

To run the server, type './server/lmserver' in the top-level directory.

The server supports the following command-line options:
Usage: ./server/lmserver [OPTION]
Options:
  -p PORTNO	set the port number to listen on (default: 16877)
  -P PASSWORD	set the admin password (default: admin mode is disabled)
  -m MAPNAME	set the map name (default: alpha1)
  -d		daemonize the server (not on Windows)
  -?, --help	display this help, and exit
      --version	display version information and exit


SPECIFYING THE DATA DIRECTORY

By default, you MUST run both the client and server from the top-level source directory, so that it can find the data files.  However, if you set the $LM_DATA_DIR environment variable to the location of the data/ directory, you may run the programs from anywhere.


CONTROLS

	space		Jump in direction of mouse pointer
	left click	Fire in direction of mouse pointer
	t		Open chat
	y		Open team chat
	~		Open console/chat
	ESC		Return to main menu / close chat console
	tab		Show the scoreboard


CLIENT COMMANDS

These commands are entered in the client's chat bar:

	/tchat MESSAGE	Send a message to your team
	/name NEWNAME	Change your name
	/team red|blue	Change teams
	/server COMMAND	Send the command to the server (see below for list of server commands)
	NAME: MESSAGE	Send message to specified player only


SERVER COMMANDS

These commands are entered in the client's chat bar.  Some commands (marked as [op]) require you to authenticate first with the password specified on the command-line to the server.

	/server auth PASSWORD	Authenticate with given password
	/server teamscore 	Return the score for each team
	/server teamcount	Return the number of players on each team
	/server reset		Reset the scores [op]
	/server map MAPNAME	Load the given map [op]
	/server newgame		Start new game [op]
	/server kick PLAYER	Kick a player [op]
	/server shutdown	Shutdown the server [op]
	/server help		Display this help

If no operator password is set, then any player connecting from the localhost (127.0.0.1) will be given operator status.  If this is undesirable behavior, then be sure to set an operator password.


GAMEPLAY

The objective of the game is to reach the opposing team's gate and stay next to it until it opens fully.

Shoot enemy players to freeze them. They will un-freeze a number of seconds after they are frozen.

You can move by jumping off of any obstacle, and you will jump in the direction of the mouse pointer. You will also move due to the recoil from firing your gun. When frozen, you will bounce off of obstacles. If you unfreeze away from obstacles, shoot your weapon to move back towards the nearest obstacle.


ORGANIZATION

The code is divided into three components, located in the following directories:

	common		Common code for both client and server
	client		The client
	server		The server

The data for the program are located in the data directory, and are divided into four parts:

	data/fonts	Fonts
	data/maps	Maps
	data/sounds	Sounds
	data/sprites	Sprites
