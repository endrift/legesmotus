ABOUT

Leges Motus is a 2D networked, team-based shooter set in zero gravity.


BUILDING AND INSTALLING

1. Run './configure' in the top level directory.
   This script will check to make sure you have the required libraries installed.

2. Run 'make' to build the server and client.

3. Run 'make install' as an administrator to install the server and client.

See "ADVANCED BUILDING" below for more advanced build options.


RUNNING THE CLIENT

To run the client, if Leges Motus is in your path, run the 'legesmotus' command.  You can also double click on legesmotus.exe on Windows and the Leges Motus application on Mac, but you cannot specify command line options in this manner.

The client supports the following command-line options:
  -n NAME	set your player name (default: your user name)
  -t red|blue	set your team (default: auto-balanced)
  -s SERVER	set the hostname of the server (default: use the server browser)
  -p PORTNO	set the port number of the server (default: 16877)
  -w WIDTH	set the screen width, in pixels (default: 1024)
  -h HEIGHT	set the screen height, in pixels (default: 768)
  -f		run the game in fullscreen
  -?, --help	display this help, and exit
      --version	display version information and exit


REQUIREMENTS

The following libraries must be installed in order to build and run the Leges Motus client:

 SDL
 SDL_image
 SDL_ttf
 SDL_mixer (optional)
 OpenGL

All of these are bundled in the Windows and Mac OS X packages, except for OpenGL, which should already be installed on the system. No additional libraries are needed to build or run the server.

If you do not have SDL_mixer installed and/or you would like to build without sound support, you may pass the --disable-sound option to configure.


RUNNING THE SERVER

To run the server, run the 'lmserver' command, or double click on lmserver.exe on Windows.

The server supports the following command-line options:
  -c CONFFILE	load server configuration options from the given file (default: no config file)
  -m MAPNAME	set the map name (default: alpha1)
  -p PORTNO	set the port number to listen on (default: 16877)
  -P PASSWORD	set the admin password (default: admin mode is disabled)
  -i ADDRESS	address of interface to listen on (default: listen on all interfaces)
  -d		daemonize the server (not on Windows)
  -u USERNAME	drop privileges to given user (only super user may use) (not on Windows)
  -g GROUPNAME	drop privileges to given group (only super user may use) (not on Windows)
  -l		(local server) do not register with the meta server
  -?, --help	display this help, and exit
      --version	display version information and exit

By default, the Leges Motus server will contact the meta server so other players on the Internet can connect to and play on the server.  If you would NOT like your server to appear in server browsers of other Internet users, pass the -l ("local") option to lmserver, or set the server configuration option "register_server" to "no".

If a server is run behind a firewall, and it is registered with the meta server, the meta server will attempt to pierce the firewall so that clients outside the firewall are able to connect to the server.  However, this technique does not work with all firewalls, and is not 100% reliable.  If you intend to host a long-running server behind a firewall, you are strongly recommended to modify your firewall settings to allow/forward UDP port 16877.


SPECIFYING THE DATA DIRECTORY

By default, Leges Motus expects to find its data in /usr/local/share/games/legesmotus.  This path can be set at compile time by passing a --prefix argument to configure.  The path can be overridden at runtime by setting the $LM_DATA_DIR environment variable to the location containing the data.  The data can be found in the 'data' directory in the top-level source directory.


CONTROLS

	space		Jump in direction of mouse pointer
	left click	Fire in direction of mouse pointer
	t		Open chat
	y		Open team chat
	~		Open chat log
	ESC		Return to main menu / close chat console
	tab		Show the scoreboard


CLIENT COMMANDS

These commands are entered in the client's chat bar:

	/tchat MESSAGE	Send a message to your team
	/name NEWNAME	Change your name
	/team red|blue	Change teams
	/server COMMAND	Send the command to the server (see below for list of server commands)
	/quit		Quit the game
	/legal		Show legal information (copyright and warranty)
	NAME: MESSAGE	Send message to specified player only


SERVER COMMANDS

These commands are entered in the client's chat bar.  Some commands (marked as [op]) require you to authenticate first with the password specified on the command-line to the server.

	/server auth PASSWORD	Authenticate with given password
	/server teamscore 	Return the score for each team
	/server teamcount	Return the number of players on each team
	/server maps		Retrieve a list of maps
	/server balance		Balance the teams [op]
	/server shakeup		Randomly reform the teams [op]
	/server reset		Reset the scores [op]
	/server map MAPNAME	Load the given map [op]
	/server newgame		Start new game [op]
	/server kick PLAYER	Kick a player [op]
	/server shutdown	Shutdown the server [op]
	/server help		Display this help

If no operator password is set, then any player connecting from the localhost (127.0.0.1) will be given operator status.  If this is undesirable behavior, then be sure to set an operator password.


GAMEPLAY

The objective of the game is to reach the opposing team's gate and stay next to it until it opens fully.

Shoot enemy players to freeze them. They will un-freeze a number of seconds after they are frozen.

You can move by jumping off of any obstacle, and you will jump in the direction of the mouse pointer. You will also move due to the recoil from firing your gun. When frozen, you will bounce off of obstacles. If you unfreeze away from obstacles, shoot your weapon to move back towards the nearest obstacle.


ORGANIZATION

The code is divided into three components, located in the following directories:

	common		Common code for both client and server
	client		The client
	server		The server
	metaserver	The meta server (you should not run a meta server)

The data for the program are located in the data directory, and are divided into four parts:

	data/fonts	Fonts
	data/maps	Maps
	data/sounds	Sounds
	data/sprites	Sprites

ADVANCED BUILDING

By default, Leges Motus will install to /usr/local.  You may change this by specifying a --prefix argument to configure.  To install into your home directory, you could use:

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/legesmotus

By default, on Mac OS X, Leges Motus will build a .app bundle, and use frameworks to find the SDL libraries.  Leges Motus will install the bundle to the system-wide /Applications directory.  To enable a traditional, Unix-style build, use:

	./configure --unix-style

Note that this requires sdl-config to be installed on your system, which it generally is not unless SDL is installed through a system such as MacPorts.

To disable building a universal binary on Mac OS X, use:

	./configure --disable-universal

To build only the server or client, use one of:

	make server
	make client

To install in a different directory (useful for making packages):

	make install DESTDIR=/path/to/package/root
